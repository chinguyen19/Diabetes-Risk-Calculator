# DiabetesCalculationApp

### Project Overview

This software tool is designed to assist healthcare professionals in assessing an individual's risk of developing diabetes based on various health parameters. It is connected to a real-time database using **_FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)_** server to make timely, accurate, and informed decisions regarding diabetes risk.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Enhanced Efficiency**: Centralizes and automates patient data entry, reducing redundant testing.
- **Reduced Errors**: Minimizes data entry mistakes and transcription errors through automation.
- **Personalized Care**: Provides tailored risk profiles and actionable insights for individualized intervention.

## Target Users

Our app is designed specifically for:
- **Healthcare Providers**: Nurses, clinicians, nutritionists, and other professionals involved in diabetes care.
- **Healthcare Facilities**: Diabetes care centers, clinics, and hospital departments focusing on chronic disease management.
